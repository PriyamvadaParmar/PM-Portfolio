# WhatsApp Product Case Study

## Overview
This case study explores WhatsApp from a **Product Manager’s perspective**, focusing on real user behavior, product trade-offs, and problem framing.

The objective is not to redesign WhatsApp superficially, but to demonstrate **PM-style thinking**:
- Understanding user segments
- Identifying tensions between simplicity and scale
- Framing a problem worth solving before jumping to solutions

This case study is part of an ongoing **PM-in-practice portfolio**.
